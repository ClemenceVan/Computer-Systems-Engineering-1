# **Smart Home Project**

Welcome to the Smart Home Project repository! This project focuses on developing an interactive home climate monitoring and control system utilizing an Atmel SAM3X8E embedded computer platform (Arduino Due) integrated with various sensors and peripherals. The system ensures optimal temperature and light intensity levels within the home environment.

## Overview

The Smart Home Project aims to create a comprehensive system for monitoring and controlling home climate conditions. Key functionalities include:

1. **Temperature Regulation**: Maintains the home temperature within the range of 20 – 25 degrees Celsius.
   
2. **Lighting Optimization**: Adjusts lighting conditions based on detected light intensity.

3. **User Interaction**: Allows users to interact with the system through a keypad for configuration and control.

4. **Sun Position Tracking**: Adjusts home environment based on the position of the sun for optimal lighting.

5. **Status Display**: Provides visual feedback and status updates to users through a display.

Implemented requirements as part of the project include:

- Calendar System
- Periodic Temperature Recording
- Recordings Display on LCD
- Sun Tracking System
- Temperature Alarms
- Fast Mode for Testing
